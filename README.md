# Welcome To Web3!

Onboarding new users into Web3 can be challenging. There's so much scattered information out there. This site is an attempt at consolidating that information and packaging it up in a delightful UI.

Web3 moves so fast, so I plan on keeping this site open source, so that the community can submit updates when information becomes outdated.

# Looking for contributers!

- Copywriter - because I'm bad at writing and need your help.
- Designer - to create fun icons, graphics, etc!
- Other developers - to help me manage this repo and future updates.

I would love your help!
